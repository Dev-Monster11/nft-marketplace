## Setup

Initialize the environment by creating a conda environment:

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

## Installation

Be sure to be running Node v14.17.6 and yarn version 1.22.10.

Build deployment:

`./deploy-web.sh`

Bootstrap yarn:

`yarn bootstrap`

Then run:

`yarn start`

You may have to rebuild your package more than one time to secure a
running environment.

## Reset

The map files generated by the 'deploy-web.sh' script cant be remove with:
`./reset.sh`

## Docker

Start a docker container by running:

`sudo docker-compose up -d`

Changes to the Docker file requires rebuilding:

`sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose build --no-cache && sudo docker-compose up -d`

## Known Issues

### Can't find CSS files in common

Common currently uses a less library to compile down less files into css in both the src directory for the TS server
in vscode to pick up and in the dist folder for importers like lending and proposal projects to pick up. If you do not see these files appear when running the `npm start lending` or other commands, and you see missing CSS errors,
you likely did not install the packages for common correctly. Try running:

`lerna exec npm install --scope @oyster/common` to specifically install packages for common.

Then, test that css transpiling is working:

`lerna exec npm watch-css-src --scope @oyster/common` and verify css files appear next to their less counterparts in src.

### Can't run git commit
This is an issue with husky interfering with git. Confirm there's nothing important in hooks (shouldn't be) and run:

`rm -rf .git/hooks`
